This folder uses the HHEA for wave energym but we've gotten rid of the whole HECM.
Here, the PTO force is made by using the PI control as before, but rounding the force to the nearest force rail

The energy absorbed with this rounding is very nearly the same as without rounding, and there are no HECM losses, which were the largest source of loss.
However, there is no longer any freedom in the pressure rail selection. We must deal with whatever flow is taken or removed from the accumulator.
