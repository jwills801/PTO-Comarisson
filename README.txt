This code compares 3 PTOS. 1) The HHEA

2) The EHA

3) The Check valve PTO

All of these are tested using a flap type wec. Regular and irrgular waves are tested. The EHA is codesigned with the controller so that energy out is maximized.

The PTO paper for the full journal paper used the code in NEWresults_2. Inside of that folder are all the codes that I used. The latest versions in these files are the ones I used. All .mat files were generated using code from this folder except for inputs to wecSim and the 107cc pump map.

The other files have older versions of the three PTO simulations. All necessary code to generate the results from the paper should be found in the folder NEWresults_2. The drive cycle for the HHEA is generated using the wecsim files in the EHA folder

Specific files are included in this file because they are too large for github. These files should not be important. They were made because the codes that generated them took a long time.
